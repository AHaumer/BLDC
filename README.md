# BLDC

Modelica library for Brushless DC drives

# Important

By now (Dec. 2021) the models are restricted to odd number of phases, spatial sinusoidal magnetic field distribution and block commutation. 
Some of the models are improvements of models taken from the Modelica Standard Library (MSL). 
It is planned to re-integrate these models in the MSL.   
Some of the newly developed models might also be integrated into the MSL in future.

# Development and contribution

The library is developed and maintained by Anton Haumer and Christian Kral.
